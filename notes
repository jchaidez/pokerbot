==Poker Notes==

=Lecture 3: Poker Strategy=

I. Play some percent of best hands (like 60 - 80 percent)
  - Compute table of rankings of hands to beget "percentile" of hand, and decide whether or not to play
II. When you are dealer ("have the button", "big blind"), play more. When you are not, play considerably less.
III. Large raising vs small raising:
  - Raising too big denys opponents ability to call profitability
  - Large sizing good for tight range (if you only play top 50 percent, instead of top 80)
  - Raising too low isn't as risky, but gives opponent better caacity to bet
IV. Implied Odds: Look this up!
  - Better chances based on extra information besides equity calculation
  - General principles:
    - Positive factor when you're on the button
    - Negative factor otherwise
V. Discarding well:
  - Computing best decision is hard when close
  - Usually won't be close
  - Solution seems to be opponent modeling
  - Make sure your behavior is consistent
  - Consider the odds against another good draw


BETTING LOGIC

1. Bet or Fold?
  a. if equity < equity_threshold(est_opponent_equity_threshold(),opp_bet_to_equity_function(),betting_round, random_num):
     FOLD
     - ideas for equity_threshold function:
       - equity_threshold ~ betting_round^x, or logarithmic? x > 0
       - equity_threshold ~ opponent_folding^x, x < 0
     - ideas for est_opponent_equity_threshold function:
       - est_opponent_equity_threshold(opponent_folding, hand_histories)
       - if hand_histories = []:
          - opponent_equity_threshold = opponent_folding_frequency
          - equity_threshold(min equity for all hands in hand_history)
  b. else, move to betting phase
3. How much to bet?
  a. bet(equity,est_opponent_bet_function,betting_round,random_num)
     - ideas for est_opponent_bet_function
       - est_opp_equity_to_bet_function(hand_histories, opponent_bet_histories)
       - use scipy to do linear regression on the point set (hand.equity,hand.last_bet)
       - inverse is opp_bet_to_equity_function()
  a. randomized function search:
